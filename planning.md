# Rogue-like Survival Management

### General game outline

- Manage a growing colony
- Perform research, evolve traits
- Ascend to a higher being and abandon your colony to legacy xp
- Level up your legacy to get skill and talent points
- Use skills and talents to get further each colony/"run"
- End Of The World (EOTW): runs have limited time before they are forced to end (some talents can improve this)
